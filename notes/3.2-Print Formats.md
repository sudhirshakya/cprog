# Printing

We use ```scanf``` to read user input data and ```printf``` to print formatted output on console.

The format that ```printf``` accepts include:

- %c. Prints the character represented by the ASCII value.
- %d, %i. Prints the integer value.
- %hd. Prints the integer value. Used to print short (2-byte integers).
- %hhd. Prints the integer value. Used to print char (1-byte integers).
- %ld. Prints the integer value. Used to print long (8-byte integers).
- %u. Prints the unsigned integer value.
- %lu. Prints unsigned long value.
- %x, %X. Prints number in hexadecimal format.
- %f, %F. Accepts floating point numbers.
- %e, %E. Prints floating point number in mantissa + exponent format.

## Printing special characters

You can print special characters using escape sequences. Escape sequences start with a backslash follwed by one of more characters. The following escape sequences are helpful:

- \t: Prints a tab character
- \n: Prints a newline character
- \\: Prints a backslash
- \": Double quotation
- \': Single quotation


## Formatting

- %5d uses at least 5 spaces to display the number. If the number can be printed in less than 5 characters, the number will be padded with spaces.
- %05d uses at least 5 spaces. Instead of spaces, it pads the number with 0.
- %8.2f uses 8 spaces to display the floating point number. It will display only 2 digits after the decimal point.
